D1 = 'Job description Work on a product that improves the end users life, health and nutrition; while not giving up your own to do so! Position: Lead Ruby Software Developer & Foodie Reports To: Product Manager Demand: Typically, 40 hours per week during normal business hours Location: Remote (within the U.S.) or on-site in Dayton, Ohio (US Citizens only please; no companies) Start Date: Flexible Application: http://bit.ly/oammrubysoftware Once a Month Meals (OAMM) is a Web-based product and community with the goal of empowering wellness through meal planning and freezer cooking. OAMM believes that your work, time and hobbies shouldn‚Äôt come at the cost of family and health. Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available‚Äîgiving our users time for what matters most. OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn‚Äôt the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product. The Position Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you‚Äôll work with freezer cooking, ‚Äúcooking math,‚Äù user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You‚Äôll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems. It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code. Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position: Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge - It isn‚Äôt enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential. Experience in the Kitchen - it doesn‚Äôt have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software‚Äôs main functions. A Love for Math - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn‚Äôt the role for you. :) Organizational Leadership - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important. Experience Working on a LIVE Product - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience. Your job duties will include: Maintaining two Rails apps Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs Build, maintain and test new features Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products Skills/Tools/Qualifications: Ruby Rails MySQL Postgres Git Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.) Stripe API Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team. The ideal candidate is: a self-starter‚Äîthey seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies a problem-solver‚Äîthey figure out how to get things done comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt competent with git and github mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis collaborative‚Äînothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they‚Äôll be better if they work with others Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus: work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails) recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community Additional experience in the following strongly desired: Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue Solr CircleCI Docker PHP The Culture OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate. üôÇ We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.

The goal is to create a seamless, intuitive transition between local and cloud environments, between individual workflows on their own machine and hosted compute jobs in the cloud. You‚Äôll be working closely with product and design, and working alongside and helping mentor team members, in order to realize this vision. Some day-to-day responsibilities Create product APIs. As the team builds feature by feature, your role will be to design and build the APIs and services. We use GraphQL and Node.js as our primary platform. Provision and manage cloud infrastructure. You will provision and manage our infrastructure, implement internal access control, auditing etc. We run on Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine, with Terraform, Postgres, etc. Service infrastructure and operations.

Could probably diagram Postgres‚Äôs architecture with a bit of thought (don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs not an interview question!). Battle scars running internet-facing, production systems. Operational knowledge of Linux, HTTP, and the ability to troubleshoot problems anywhere across the stack. Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn‚Äôt required You‚Äôve used GraphQL before. You may have experimented a bit with GraphQL on a personal toy project. We use GraphQL heavily at Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud, so it‚Äôs a plus to have some level of familiarity.

Challenging technical problems. Scaling, container orchestration, running untrusted code at scale. These challenging engineering endeavors and problems are complex, but rewarding and oh so fun. The worst parts of this job Shifting context. You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you‚Äôre unfamiliar with or don‚Äôt have a ton of understanding about. We move quickly, but don‚Äôt sacrifice quality. We ship. Early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence we ship features and improvements to end users.
