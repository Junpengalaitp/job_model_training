Position: Lead Ruby Software Developer & Foodie Reports To: Product Manager Demand: Typically, 40 hours per week during normal business hours Location: Remote (within the U.S.) or on-site in Dayton, Ohio (US Citizens only please; no companies) Start Date: Flexible Application: http://bit.ly/oammrubysoftware Once a Month Meals (OAMM) is a Web-based product and community with the goal of empowering wellness through meal planning and freezer cooking. OAMM believes that your work, time and hobbies shouldn‚Äôt come at the cost of family and health. Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available‚Äîgiving our users time for what matters most. OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn‚Äôt the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product. The Position Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you‚Äôll work with freezer cooking, ‚Äúcooking math,‚Äù user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You‚Äôll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems. It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code. Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position: Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge - It isn‚Äôt enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential. Experience in the Kitchen - it doesn‚Äôt have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software‚Äôs main functions. A Love for Math - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn‚Äôt the role for you. :) Organizational Leadership - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important. Experience Working on a LIVE Product - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience. Your job duties will include: Maintaining two Rails apps Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs Build, maintain and test new features Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products Skills/Tools/Qualifications: Ruby Rails MySQL Postgres Git Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.) Stripe API Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team. The ideal candidate is: a self-starter‚Äîthey seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies a problem-solver‚Äîthey figure out how to get things done comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt competent with git and github mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis collaborative‚Äînothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they‚Äôll be better if they work with others Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus: work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails) recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community Additional experience in the following strongly desired: Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue Solr CircleCI Docker PHP The Culture OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively.

Challenging technical problems. Scaling, container orchestration, running untrusted code at scale. These challenging engineering endeavors and problems are complex, but rewarding and oh so fun. The worst parts of this job Shifting context. You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you‚Äôre unfamiliar with or don‚Äôt have a ton of understanding about. We move quickly, but don‚Äôt sacrifice quality. We ship. Early, often, and quickly.

D9 = "Knack is hiring a senior javascript engineer! You‚Äôll be an integral part of our engineering team focused on building and scaling a world-class product. We do things a little differently here at Knack, and that‚Äôs just how we like it: Flat: we don‚Äôt have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions. Autonomous: our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact. Engaged: our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work. Remote: to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues. This isn‚Äôt for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work. This is a senior position, so we‚Äôre looking for a strong track record of shipping code and building products at scale. With that said, we‚Äôre not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we‚Äôre interested. About the Job Our senior engineers are ultimately responsible for delivering an outstanding product. This includes: Implementing new features. Optimizing our systems for performance, including speed, reliability, redundancy, and geographic distribution. Fixing bugs and issues. Working with our success team to address customer issues and concerns. Building tools and processes to improve our operations and help us detect and respond to issues. How you‚Äôll do this: Program: ship code every day Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities. Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product. Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn. You won‚Äôt have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 6, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects. You‚Äôll also work closely with the founders, Brandon & Eric, on strategy and technical implementations. Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done. Our stack AWS - we‚Äôve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board. Node.js - APIs Solr - data search MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB - data persistence jQuery, Backbone - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript, with some Backbone for models and routing. We‚Äôre currently exploring moving to a component-based framework. Github, Jenkins, Ghost Inspector, Mocha - deployment and testing About You Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that‚Äôs products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins. You‚Äôre both a teacher and a learner. You‚Äôre not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up. You‚Äôre an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You‚Äôre not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers. You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams. You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world‚Äôs biggest companies. You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact. About Knack Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data. Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we‚Äôve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We‚Äôre now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be. So why are we different? We‚Äôre bootstrapped: we‚Äôve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things. We‚Äôre 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we‚Äôve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations. We‚Äôre small: and we like it that way. We‚Äôre more than just chat avatars-- we‚Äôve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other. We enjoy the journey: we‚Äôre in this for the long haul. We‚Äôre not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We‚Äôre building something we‚Äôre proud of and want to keep improving on. You can read more about Knack and the team here. Benefits & Compensation Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we‚Äôve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries. Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It‚Äôs not about separation, it‚Äôs about optimization. Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You‚Äôll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries. Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals. Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences. HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children)."

We don‚Äôt care where you went to college (or even that you went at all) ‚Äì all that matters is whether you can do it. We won‚Äôt be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will send a list of interview questions in writing, then, for the few we like best, set up a brief call to discuss the opportunity. The deadline for submissions is September 15th , though those who apply sooner are at an advantage. We‚Äôll pick two candidates from interviews to begin a paid two-week trial (to assess on-the-job performance and cultural fit). One person will then be chosen for the ongoing role.
