D2 = 'Loco2 is looking for an experienced mobile engineer to help us deliver a world-class mobile experience through our hybrid iOS and Android apps, combining fully native views with our single-page application (see below). This is a full-time position, working office hours, usually from 9.30-6 GMT. There’s flexibility in working hours and we offer a generous holiday allowance and a salary that reflects your experience. This is a remote position, although you may be required to visit the office in Old Street to attend business meetings, events, and so on. At Loco2 we care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We behave with respect for people and the planet and are seeking a diverse range of candidates that share these values. About us We\'re a small, passionate and cosmopolitan team, with a healthy remote-first culture and an office in London. Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with our users at the centre of what we do. We\'re proud to have an average rating of 9 out of 10 on Trustpilot after nearly 50,000 reviews. We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 (read our full story here), and we’re growing rapidly as the business matures. Our goal is to scale effectively whilst continuing to delight our users. Our culture Why join us We have high standards for our code. If you care about security, performance, and reliability, you\'ll fit in with our team. We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves. We offer flexible hours and a well-designed remote working culture built on trust. Work around your schedule and when you’re most productive. Our days are not full of meetings and needless distractions. Allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other. We strive for a balance between collaboration and focused independent work that works for everyone. Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard. Tech stack Our current mobile applications present the website on mobile devices in embedded web-views. We’re sticking with this hybrid approach (i.e., we don’t intend to have fully native apps any time soon) but are now transitioning our traditional multi-page web application to a React-powered single-page application (SPA). Once we’ve transitioned to the SPA, more functionality and UX elements will be consistent across our mobile website and applications, but there will remain areas where we’ll need to use native functionality. One of Loco2’s main goals is to be useful to customers when they are travelling, and building an exceptional mobile UX that feels truly native is one of our biggest goals for the future. Whilst we don’t expect you to be a master of everything, you should have some familiarity with our mobile stack: A React + TypeScript SPA A hybrid iOS app written in Swift A hybrid Android app written in Kotlin Other things you might get involved with, if you wanted to, include: A traditional multi-page web application written in Ruby on Rails, using CoffeeScript and SCSS A Ruby library for communicating with train-booking APIs AWS-hosted Docker infrastructure, with continuous delivery About you We\'re looking for a senior engineer with at least a few years of professional mobile application development experience. Our definition of "professional" includes: Taking pride in our work Writing automated tests for (most of) our code Keeping things consistent (e.g., code linting) Constructive peer reviews Writing clear, modular, maintainable code You should also be familiar with our front-end tech stack. It\'s important that you be comfortable working on the iOS and Android parts of our codebase. You should also have some skill with React and TypeScript. Our ideal candidate will also: Work hours that have some overlap with London daytime Be motivated by Loco2\'s mission Speak English fluently Be happy with a salary within the range of £55,000 to 70,000 (or equivalent in another currency) Be comfortable reading and writing clear, declarative English sentences. Because we work remotely and have a lot of written documentation, good communication is just as important as good code. Have a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but won\'t hesitate to ask for help when needed Strive to discover and understand the root cause of problems Suggest new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms'

D4 = "Seeq makes data analytics software for a big market that’s often overlooked by tech companies: industrial process data.

Our software engineers tackle hard problems in streaming calculation, storage and distributed computing, and we create elegant HTML5 data visualizations with smooth interactivity. Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. We use a variety of collaboration tools, like Zoom and Slack, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together.

You will interact with customers directly (usually over Zoom webconferencing) to troubleshoot technical issues with our software. You will be a member of the product development team, and will have a strong voice in shaping development effort to improve customer satisfaction and mitigate common pain points.
