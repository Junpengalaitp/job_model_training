D2 = "Job description We are looking for a full stack (Python) web application developers to join the team at Level 12: TL;DR: Why Consider This Position? We give you a lot of information in the job description so that you can figure out if you'd really like to work here. We have a commitment to transparency and offer a “no surprises experience” throughout the interview and hiring process. We practice and preach sound development practices. You are likely to learn and grow as a developer while working here. Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics). You will have the option of working from home or our office , whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary. We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members. We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are designed so that you actually use them. A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology. You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect & run with a medium sized project mostly on your own. You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc. You are committed to automated testing of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage). You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming . You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here! Daily Responsibilities Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL). In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS. This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done. While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer. Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months. The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is essential . Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software. We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints. What We Offer Pay: $80-$105K (mid-level), $105K-$125K (Senior). We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark. Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle. Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment. Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually). One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance. We rarely work more than 40 hours a week. We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back. PTO/Vacation: Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year. Up to 12 sick days per year. 9 Holidays Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons. Telecommuting : Remote candidates are welcome to apply. Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local. We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work. We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires. Full Job Description & Application Instructions Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: https://level12.io/careers/ Senior Developer The candidate for the Senior Developer position will usually have 6-10 years relevant experience and meet the following requirements: Technical Skills Are able to write modular, well-tested, and maintainable code Know a software development domain really well and radiate that knowledge to our team and beyond Are able to work on multiple projects as needed Leadership Leads the design for customer projects with feedback from other engineers Proposes new ideas for improving the development team, customer projects, and/or our tech stack Adheres to and promotes our development culture and mission For Team Leads (see below): invests in other team members to see that they are growing as individuals and to facilitate productivity within our team.

Leadership In addition to the leadership expectations noted above, some of our senior developers will also be involved in leading other developers and interacting with customers.

But if you like and are good at interacting with people, we will have opportunities for you to lead teams and/or projects. Candidate Feedback GB, 8/2018 Well the work looks really interesting and appealing but more than that the job posting is like nothing else I've seen so far. It appears to be more thorough, personal, caring, and honest by far than any other I've seen. In my experience there are qualities present in a company's management that tend to permeate through all levels and find expression in many subtle ways. If I am reading into what I am seeing correctly then this would be an exceptional place to work. I'm not sure how to say it other than that. It was just kind of a feeling after looking over the page, that this is where I want to be. JF, 10/2018 I'm extremely impressed with how much effort your organization puts into describing work opportunities! By far, this is the most helpful job posting I have ever seen. I intend to respond in a point-by-point fashion, as that seems to be the most efficient way to proceed. I hope to repay honesty with honesty. JH 8/2018: Like I mentioned before, I really like the whole interview process that you guys have. That in combination with how you guys responded to emails, etc. gave me a very positive impression of your company and I am still interested in working with you guys someday. LB, 8/2018 The feedback I received from [your first skills assessment] was amazing! That was fantastic! I was really impressed with it. KM, 9/2018 I just wanted to reach out and give you some really positive feedback. If I could go back in time and finish up those final interviews with you, I would do it in a heartbeat. I can already see a huge difference in personality between you and those who lead the company I joined -- and I think it speaks volumes. Keep being a great person! I hope you found a great candidate in the end! Full Job Description & Application Instructions Above are just highlights.

Step up to resolve product issues – large and small. Identify opportunities to increase searches and enhance the standard of trust online.

Expect to travel at least two times a year: once for our all-hands meetup and again for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days). We believe in a focused approach to collaboration, where individual team members work on a single top priority at a time, each supporting larger, company-wide objectives.

Transparency supports individual and team success at DuckDuckGo. We encourage everyone to participate in areas of interest throughout the company. Anyone and everyone can (and should) ask questions and offer feedback about our products and internal projects.

We support professional development of our team members through career advisory and a learning stipend, reinforcing our culture of growth and skill-building.
