Empowerment – We empower our team, our clients, their providers and patients to make the right decisions. About Kyruus's Search Team Kyruus has a mission to solve the patient access paradox by making sure to match patients to the right provider (e.g. doctor) the first time. One of the main catalysts for this paradox is that the variety of data that represents a provider is not straight forward nor in one place. The time spent by patients combing through that information on their own can lead to added time in finding the right care. On the KyruusOne team, we work hard to minimize mistakes when it comes to getting the data you need. This all starts with rich data sets of provider information that need to be canonicalized, normalized, and transformed into a warehouse that is accessible to all our applications. The team is a collaborative group of software engineers that tackle: provider data models, scalable APIs, intuitive workflows in the UI while tying together the different aspects of data management like bulk editing, canonicalization, and large datasets.

You are comfortable taking on tasks with ambiguous business requirements and unclear technical strategy. You’ll use your technical expertise and mental resilience to identify bring order to chaos in terms of defining technical strategy and clarity of incremental execution. You’ll provide technical mentorship to fellow engineers. You’ll work with Engineering management and Product to get customer feedback to inform our architecture and technical designs that could span multiple functional systems. You’ll report to the Manager, Engineering in the Routing & Scheduling or in the PME & PatientOne department within the R&D - Engineering division. Respect How You’ll Use Your Professional Skills You’ll use your 8+ years programming experience to: Help your Agile team develop pragmatic and scalable solutions to complex technical design problems and user workflows by building out Python/Flask based API’s, working with Elasticsearch to build performant queries to get the best possible match for patients.

Exceed the expectations and requirements of internal and external customers with high quality designs and code Assess business value, tech debt, and tradeoffs during task prioritization. You’ll use your experience in/familiarity with technologies relevant to Kyruus to: Build, scale, and deliver dynamic and highly-available enterprise solutions Think creatively about how to use technology and tools to solve problems faced by our users and customers Evaluate and recommend new technologies relevant to add to our stack.
