D1 = "DESCRIPTION ***Please read this entire job description carefully, as it provides a detailed overview of what it’s like to work at FullStack. We provide this information to help you decide if FullStack is right for you.*** FullStack Labs is a leading software consultancy seeking creative and skilled developers to join our fast growing team. Our mission is to design and develop technology that improves the lives of its users, while providing an exceptionally high level of service to our clients. We are looking for experienced developers who want to be part of a fast-paced, dynamic environment, where everyone’s opinions and efforts are valued. We hire outstanding professionals and give them the opportunity to thrive in a collaborative atmosphere that values learning, growth, and hard work. Our team of 60+ professionals is distributed across our three offices in California, Washington D.C., and Barranquilla, Colombia. Additionally, many of our team members who aren’t located near one of our offices, work remotely. We provide a highly competitive compensation and benefits package with health insurance, overtime pay, PTO, etc. What it’s Like to Work at FullStack Labs FullStack Labs is a software consultancy. If you come to work at FullStack you will be a software consultant. Companies hire consultants to help them solve problems that they are incapable of solving on their own. So by definition, the problems that companies hire us to solve tend to be hard problems. Ultimately, solving problems is what we’re hired to do, and building technology is how we go about doing it. So as a software consultant at FullStack, your job will be to help us solve our client’s problems. To do this, you will need strong problem solving skills in addition to strong technical skills. Problem solving often comes down to being able to figure out solutions to problems when no obvious solutions exist. This ability to “figure it out” is often the most important skill possessed by our top performers. If you like solving problems and helping people, then you will enjoy being a software consultant. If you don’t like solving hard problems, or if you rely on your manager or your team members to solve problems for you, or if you give up easily or are easily frustrated by hard problems, then you probably won’t be happy at FullStack. FullStack provides three primary types of consulting services to clients: 1) Design and develop new web and mobile applications; 2) Take over development of existing, legacy applications; 3) Staffing and team augmentation. As a developer at FullStack, each project that you work on will fit into one of these three buckets. Some of our projects are relatively short (3 months or so) and some of our projects are long term (3 years). So depending on the length of the project you are assigned to, you may spend a lot of time on one type of project (a long term staffing project for instance), or if you’re assigned to shorter term projects, then you may jump from project type to project type more frequently. We’re looking for developers who are flexible and willing to work on all three types of projects, and are open to working on both long term projects and short term projects. If you’re looking to only work on new apps, or you’re unwilling to work on legacy systems, or you don’t like jumping from project to project, or you don’t like being on one project for more than a few months, then you might not be happy at FullStack. Here’s more information on the different project types. Design & Build About one third of our projects are design / build, meaning we design and build the application from the ground up. This includes iOS, Android, and web applications. For these projects, we typically start with a design and discovery phase, which includes designing the app and building a clickable prototype, then building a development estimate based on the prototype. We also conduct a technical discovery process to uncover hidden technical challenges and solutions, prior to starting the project. To see a detailed description of the process we use to design and build new apps, please review our Playbook, which can be found in the About Us section of our website. As a developer at FullStack, you may be responsible for building new apps from start to finish. Sometimes this will be as part of a team with other developers, and sometimes (on smaller projects) you will do this on your own. To be successful at FullStack, you will need to possess the skills and work ethic to be able to build new applications from start to finish. Legacy Systems About one third of our projects consist of taking over development of legacy systems. Often these are apps that were built by other consultancies, and the client wants to move development to a new consultancy. Sometimes these are apps that were built inhouse, and the client has decided to eliminate their internal development team and outsource 100% of the work to us instead. The age and technology stacks for these legacy applications can vary. Sometimes the apps are pretty old, and other times they are relatively young. Sometimes these apps are well built, and other times they are in subpar condition. In all cases, the legacy system will come with its own unique set of challenges, and the client is counting on us to dig in and improve the quality of their app, and help them solve problems. As a developer at FullStack, you may be assigned to work on a legacy system, either individually or as part of a team. If you don’t like working on older systems which may have a variety of problems, and if you don’t have the problem solving skills necessary to successfully overcome these types of problems, then you might not be happy at FullStack. Staffing / Team Augmentation About one third of our projects consist of staffing / team augmentation. For these projects, we embed between one and ten developers into a client’s existing team, and the client is responsible for planning sprints, outlining work, etc. Often staffing projects are for larger, name brand companies, but sometimes they are for smaller companies as well. Sometimes the client is really good at planning sprints and outlining work, and other times it's incumbent upon us to help them determine what to work on. Sometimes, staffing projects can be short term (a couple of months) and sometimes they can be long term (a couple of years). In most cases, we follow the client’s way of doing things, as opposed to our way of doing things, so we have to flexible and adaptive and willing to try doing things their way. Also, since we’re working on an existing app, these projects always consist of working on legacy systems, as opposed to building new apps. And since we’re embedding our developers into their team, there’s a lot of visibility internally at the client, so professionalism becomes more important. To be successful and happy and FullStack, you will need to be able to embed yourself into a client’s existing team, learn their ways of doing things, quickly get up to speed on their application, quickly start helping them solve problems and overcome challenges, and conduct yourself in a professional manner that reflects well on FullStack. Time Tracking, Estimates, and Deadlines Estimates, time tracking, and deadlines are challenges that are often encountered when consulting. Before clients hire us, they usually need to know how much we will charge them for our work, so that they can get their budget approved and make sure they can afford to engage us. In order to help them determine this, we build estimates. For new apps, the estimates are based on the prototypes created by our design team. For legacy systems, we generally build a product road map and create an estimate based on that. Once we provide these estimates to clients, they expect us to hit them (or at least come close). As things change throughout the project we update the estimate to reflect the changes. To help our teams hit project estimates, we break the estimates down into sprint-based estimates. When our project managers and team leads create stories for each new sprint, they assign an estimated number of hours to each story. Then for each sprint (which lasts for two weeks) we assign each developer approximately 80 hours worth of stories. We then track our time against the assigned stories using Toggl (time tracking software), which we integrate with Jira. The developers are expected to complete the stories within the allotted time. Everyone misses sprints from time to time, which is to be expected, since estimating stories is hard. Rarely, developers will consistently miss sprint after sprint after sprint, which becomes a problem as it means we will miss the estimate for the entire project, and miss deadlines. Tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines is part of being a software consultant. These things aren’t necessarily fun, and nobody loves doing them. But they come with the territory when consulting. For 98% of the developers we hire, these things are no big deal, but for roughly 2%, these things are really troubling and are a source of unhappiness. So before accepting a job with us, make sure that tracking time, working against estimates, and hitting deadlines are things you can do well. Being a Team Player Our development teams usually consist of 1 - 3 developers, a project manager, a quality assurance professional, a designer, and product owner. At FullStack, software development is a team sport, and you will need to be a team player. The rest of your team members (and our clients) will be counting on you each and every day. So it will be important that you consistently do your best work, and don’t let your team members down. If you’re more of a lone wolf, or if you’re looking for a remote position that will allow you to work by yourself with little communication with your manager or team members, then FullStack isn’t the right company for you. Working Hours and Remote Work Our team is distributed across North and South America, and we all work during normal local business hours. Everyone is expected to work 40 hours per week, and we track how much everyone works using Toggl. Our time tracking isn’t simply entering the hours you worked at the end of the day or the end of the week. We track our time by client, project, and feature, which affords our clients a lot of visibility into what we’re working on and what we’re getting done. An advantage of tracking time in this way, is that it allows us to pay overtime when FullStackers work more than 40 hours per week. We often offer OT but rarely require it. For developers who choose to work OT, it can significantly increase earnings by 25% or more per year. For communication with team members, clients, etc., we use Slack, and there’s a lot of collaboration throughout the day within our Slack channels. We expect team members to be available in Slack throughout the day, and able to jump into a Zoom video meeting on short notice to collaborate with team members and meet with managers. We find that face-to-face video meetings are more effective than phone calls, and we do a lot of them, so you’ll need a strong internet connection and a presentable work environment and be able to jump into video meetings throughout the day. Wrapping it All Up Being a software consultant is a fun, challenging, and rewarding career choice for developers. Your contributions are highly valued by clients, and the work you do often has a direct and significant impact on client’s businesses. You will have the chance to work on a variety of projects for a variety of clients, which will help you quickly improve as a consultant and a software developer. You will get to work with modern languages and frameworks alongside some of the best developers in the world. So if you have the desire to be a part of an exciting, challenging and rapidly-growing software development consultancy, and if you are passionate about software development and consulting, please apply below. What You’ll Be Doing Work with fellow FullStackers to build web, desktop, and mobile applications using Ruby on Rails, and other cutting edge technologies.

D2 = 'Gatsby’s Learning team is looking for a software engineer to help learners of all skill levels enjoy the experience of making sites with Gatsby. About Us Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, accessible, and astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (our work is public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type. Details of the Role Type of Work: Full-time employee Location: Remote (Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4) Engineering Level: Staff L5/L6 (see our Engineering Levels Guide) Why we’re hiring Gatsby is growing fast, and we need help improving Gatsby’s learning experience to help it realize its potential! We’ve invested heavily in documentation, with 800+ pages worth of documentation & a beautiful and intuitive UI (if we do say so ourselves!). Yet Gatsby’s surface area is so large that the #1 request from the community is still for more and better documentation. Why this is interesting Gatsby’s Learning team is shaping the future of web through documentation and best practice examples; bringing React, Node.js and GraphQL to the content web; setting new standards for website performance and accessibility; and showing the potential of “content mesh” in integrating data sources. Tens of thousands of users use Gatsby to build beautiful, performant sites every month. The Learning team are guides for these users. What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis As a Learning team member, your work will mostly be a mix of four things: Create targeted, methodical documentation. We’ve identified key learning workflows to help people of all skill levels build Gatsby sites, and you’ll be tweaking and sometimes overhauling these. You’ll think carefully about key user types and creating written content, example code & repos, and audiovisual material to address their needs. Work with the community and create community-driven documentation. We keep our pulse on the pain points the community is experiencing in order to guide our work. Perhaps a thread on Twitter reveals a patchy article that can be cleaned up with a couple hours of work and thought. In addition, much of Gatsby’s functionality is driven by the community via the plugin ecosystem. The documentation should provide an up-to-date, helpful overview of community plugins available in a given area and direct the user to further resources, even as the ecosystem rapidly grows richer. Provide documentation-related development. We’ve been focused recently on the thousand little details that go into a beautiful and accessible UI — from a nested sidebar that expands and remembers where you are, to floating table of contents, feedback box, next/previous buttons at the bottom, breadcrumbs, a dedicated search page, and so on. We’re soon going to be crossing the boundary to creating next-generation developer documentation — allowing users to automatically track their learning journey as they complete Gatsby tutorials, bootstrapping a test suite from human-readable docs, and so on. Support other Gatsby teams. Other teams at Gatsby, such as core (Open Source) and themes, are quickly shipping features. Everyone is expected to document their feature (see “why we write”), so they contribute documentation PRs, and the Learning team works with them to polish them, flesh them out, help them get merged, and create additional, richer material as necessary. In addition, you will Streamline and simplify. Like code, sometimes the best documentation PRs remove more lines than they add. Especially with much of the documentation contributed by independent community efforts, it can he helpful to constantly ask if docs should be combined or culled. Help people contribute to open source. The docs are often the easiest and most accessible way for Gatsby users to give back. We believe that “you belong here” and that open source is great for developers — the learning team is in a position to facilitate positive experiences. Bring novel ideas to the table. New techniques. A great new library you’ve had your eye on. Insightful feedback on other learning and ecosystem improvements. Share your expertise with others—internally and in the Gatsby community. As the Gatsby team grows, you’ll have mentorship opportunities as well. Experience and skills you should have The Learning team is composed of people with skills in multiple areas: content, development, and collaboration. Content A track record of producing high-quality, written technical communication. Whether produced for your personal blog, or for a company (externally or internally), you’ve spent significant amounts of time writing deeply technical material for a technologist audience. You also should enjoy writing. A big part of creating high-quality documentation is a team that takes pride in tightly crafted content. You have to care. Ability to dive into complex problems and corpuses of text. Norris numbers apply to content, not just codebases. Writing three good paragraphs is significantly less complex than writing a comprehensive essay, which is significantly less complex than writing a five-part series, which is significantly less complex than writing a book. For this role we’re looking for demonstrated aptitude somewhere between “comprehensive essay” and “five-part series” (more is a big plus!). With that experience, you should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our docs codebase. Ability to adjust learning content for a specific audience or outcome. Gatsby has docs in multiple types and formats, each accommodating a different learning style or skill level. Development Professional experience shipping production code and solving user/customer problems. We’ll have to build for new platforms (an Electron app on the desktop!) and create materials in new formats as our ambitions and standards continue to rise. Building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Appreciation of all of the working parts of the Web Platform would help you write better docs for people who aren’t yet familiar with Gatsby’s way of doing things. A desire to work in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. Gatsby is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies like Node.js, GraphQL, React, webpack, and Babel. Collaboration Experience editing content produced by others (technical or non-technical) . Perhaps you’ve taken a bunch of assorted READMEs and crafted them into an onboarding guide. Perhaps you spontaneously take a red pen to friends’ essays or blog posts. Perhaps you notice yourself editing Google Docs sent out by colleagues to make them more clear. Strong personal communication skills. As part of our Learning team, you’d both directly and indirectly interface with community members. Clear, friendly, and professional communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources. Ready and willing to ask and answer questions. If you’re comfortable saying you’re unsure, asking for help, and reaching out to assist others, you’ll be an incredible addition to our team. Our team thrives because of continuous learning and a willingness to work together. Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required You have done public speaking, developer advocacy, or teaching. On the Gatsby learning team, we often have opportunities to present on Gatsby topics at conferences and workshops. While the opportunity to grow into this skillset will still be there, experience as a public speaker would help you ramp up faster. Experience recording development screencasts is also helpful. You have a passion for web accessibility. As maintainers of a website framework, we have an opportunity to make the web more inclusive and accessible for everyone. Previous experience with accessible web development and content creation would help you to stand out from other candidates. You have maintained documentation in an active repository before. Maybe you’ve helped maintain a popular open source repo, or maybe you’ve worked on internal repos that saw contributions from multiple teams. Previous experience with highly active repo workflows is a definite plus for this role. The best parts of this job You’ll be empowered to propose ideas for new learning content and ecosystem improvements for key learning workflows. You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site building frameworks on the market, digging into the Gatsby’s innovatively architected docs system and codebase, using modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL. You’ll be part of an active, open, friendly community of developers that are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites. You’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented engineers who have a broad range of experience. Your role will be key to making Gatsby the next way to build on the web — and a technology that is accessible to the next billion internet users. The worst parts of this job As the Learning team for a fast-paced startup, we are often tasked with supporting multiple teams for product launches and events. This requires balancing priorities and working together to ensure we’re working on things that provide the most value. In open source, you’re faced with a nonstop stream of issues and pull requests. That means you need to develop an intuition of how to prioritize tasks for Learning/Core team needs and those from the community. When working in the open–including fielding user feedback on social media–it can sometimes be difficult to remain professional when things don’t go as planned. Gatsby team members are expected to act as bridges between communities even when it’s hard, because we’re all better off for it. Benefits you will receive 3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only) Skip the commute with remote work Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups Stock options in a fast-growing startup Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure'

D8 = 'Who we are We are Worthy - and so are you! We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future. We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street! Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save & grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities. We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We\'re on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker. Who you are You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred. You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts. You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients. You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all. You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit & integration tests to catch all the others. You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code. Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity. For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows. You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role\'s responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn\'t require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!). What you’ll do We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote. Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed. You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning & prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems. You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt. What you’ll get you can work remote from anywhere in the U.S. or from our office in Boca Raton, FL you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync) competitive salary for a remote position health insurance & stock options more benefits as we continue growing How to apply We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks. Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can "see" your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it. In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like. We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO. There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it. We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.'
