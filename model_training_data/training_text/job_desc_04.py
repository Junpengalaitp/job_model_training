It’s really very, very significant.” -Elon Musk Once a fringe thing hippies did, “going solar” is now going mainstream. It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it’s becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future. With rapid growth & mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it’s still a challenge to find customers. Since customers that convert into sales are the lifeblood of any company, sales leads are the raw tool that unleashes massive growth for solar installers. That’s why we built SolarLeadFactory. About Us: SolarLeadFactory has helped over 600,000 homeowners looking to buy solar. We have helped hundreds of solar installers grow their businesses - and aim to help thousands more. Our business is built on a proprietary software platform allowing us to deliver a best in class product and innovate constantly. We have in-house developers, digital marketing experts & scientists relentlessly driving the product forward. Our mission: unlock consumer demand for solar power. Our software is the backbone of our business.

Build your own tech, or use off the shelf parts? In our experience ( https://solarleadfactory.com/why-we-chose-to-build-our-own-lead-distribution-software/ ), the flexibility of building our own tech has far outweighed the costs, and we’re committed to constantly improving what we’ve built.

You want to be part of a small but driven team making a big impact on one of the most pressing issues of our time. You share some of our core values including “Making Learning the Key Metric”, “Holding Yourself Accountable”, “Always be Testing Something,” and “Master your Craft”. You are an experienced full-stack developer who loves the art of writing code, and wants to contribute to elegant technology solutions to help accelerate the adoption rate of solar power.
