We do weekly meetings via Appear which are used to discuss progress and plan what's coming next. The biggest perk of working at The Offix is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience.

Office costs covered Whether you prefer a home office or a co-working space, we'll help pay for it. Dog friendly office Just kidding we literally don't have an office - but apparently tech companies think is an important detail to put on job descriptions and we didn't want to feel left out. So, um. Feel free to work with your dog. How to apply We don't hire people often, and positions rarely open up. So when we do add a member to the team, we're pretty diligent about it. This is a very different attitude to most companies. We’re profitable, we have unlimited runway, and extremely healthy revenue growth. There is no investor pressure or time limit or need to hire as many people as fast as possible to fill a fancy office. We want to keep the team as small as we can, automate as much as possible with robots, build great software, and enjoy our work as much as possible. Those are the things we optimise for. If that sounds like a good fit for you, then we’d encourage you to get in touch. All jobs at The Offix start with an application form, progressing to 1-2 short phone interviews, and finally a paid trial project. Rather than trying to guess if we'll work well together based on lengthy arbitrary interview questions or \"code challenges\" - instead we invite promising candidates to work on a real life trial project with us and pay them for their time. Trial projects are typically 1-2 weeks of work, and give us an opportunity to get to know each other prior to pursuing a full time offer. It’s also a chance for candidates to get to know the Offix team and make sure that it’s a good fit for them.
