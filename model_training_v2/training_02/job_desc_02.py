More about working in Engineering at Octane AI We believe the happier you are, the more productive you and the team are. Being a remote company allows us to work from wherever we'd prefer. Spend your evenings and weekends with your family/friends/hobbies. We hate bureaucracy. Feel free to talk to anyone in the team. Your ideas are welcome. If you know how to improve our codebase, our product, our processes, don't be shy to share it. In our weekly meetings we do a fun thing called \"fast parrot\". Everybody, including the CEO, is involved. It's a little weird and fun at the same time, especially if you are doing a meeting from a public place. Our release process involves code review. In rare cases, we deploy without it, but we try hard to make sure at least one more pair of eyes looks at the code. Flexible working hours. We have only two meetings a week (they're back-to-back) where the whole team participates and it's necessary to be online. For the rest of the time, it's up to you to choose the most productive schedule for your work. Three days a month we have \"maintenance days\" where you choose what to work on. Usually we work on tech debt, i.e. code cleanup or purely tech improvements. Don't work if you are sick. It's way better to rest and recover quicker than work at half power for a long time. If you feel you are stuck with a task don't hesitate to ask for help. There are no stupid questions, nobody expects you to know everything.
